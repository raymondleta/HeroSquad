## Description and Usage
This program uses spark forms and the velocity template engine to allow users to create individual heros specify
their attributes and add them to a squad they have created. Spark allows the users to save the data they have creates into 
sessions and display them. The functionality of this program has been created using Java, with the creation of Individual 
classes to hold Hero and Squad attributes.
